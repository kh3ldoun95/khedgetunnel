<details>
<summary><code><strong>"Workers Deployment Text Tutorial"</strong></code></summary>

1. Deploy CF Worker:
   - Create a new Worker in the CF Worker console.
   - Paste the content of [worker.js](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/blob/main/_worker.js) into the Worker editor.
   - Modify line 7 `userID` to your own **UUID**.

2. Access Subscription Content:
   - Access `https://[YOUR-WORKERS-URL]/[UUID]` to get the subscription content.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10` is your universal adaptive subscription address.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub` Base64 subscription format, suitable for PassWall, SSR+, etc.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?clash` Clash subscription format, suitable for OpenClash, etc.
   - For example, `https://vless.google.workers.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sb` Singbox subscription format, suitable for Singbox, etc.

3. Bind Custom Domain to Workers:
   - In the Workers console, go to the `Triggers` tab and click `Add Custom Domain`.
   - Enter the subdomain you've pointed to CF DNS, e.g., `vless.google.com`, then click `Add Custom Domain`. Wait for the certificate to take effect.
   - **If you're a beginner, you can now just go ahead and don't need to read further!!!**

4. Use Your Own `Preferred Domain`/`Preferred IP` for Subscription Content:
   - If you want to use your own preferred domain or IP, refer to the [WorkerVless2sub GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) for deployment instructions.
   - Open the [worker.js](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/blob/main/_worker.js) file and find the `sub` variable on line 12. Modify it to the address of your deployed subscription generator. For example, `let sub = 'sub.cmliussss.workers.dev';`, make sure to remove the `https://` and other protocol symbols.
   - **Note:** If you use your own subscription address, ensure the `sub` domain and `[YOUR-WORKER-URL]` domain are in the same top-level domain; otherwise, there may be issues. You can assign the `sub` variable with the domain assigned by workers.dev.

   - In the CF Pages console, select `Upload Assets`, give your project a name, click `Create Project`, then upload the downloaded [main.zip](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file and click `Deploy Site`.
   - Once deployment is complete, click `Continue to Site`, then go to `Settings` > `Environment Variables`, define a variable for production environment > `Add Variable`.
     Variable name should be **UUID**, with the value being your UUID, then click `Save`.
   - Go back to the `Deploy` tab, click `Create New Deployment` in the bottom right, upload the [main.zip](https://github.com/cmliu/edgetunnel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file again and click `Save and Deploy`.

2. Access Subscription Content:
   - Access `https://[YOUR-PAGES-URL]/[YOUR-UUID]` to get the subscription content.
   - For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10` is your universal adaptive subscription address.
   - For example, `https://edgetunnel.pages.dev/90cd4a77-141a-43c9-991b-08263cfe9c10?sub` Base64 subscription format, suitable for PassWall, SSR+, etc.

   - **If you're a beginner, after binding your Pages custom domain, you're ready to go!**

4. Use Your Own `Preferred Domain`/`Preferred IP` for Subscription Content:
   - If you want to use your own preferred domain or IP, refer to the [WorkerVless2sub GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cmliu/WorkerVless2sub) for deployment instructions.
   - In the Pages console's `Settings` tab, go to `Environment Variables` > `Create` > `Edit Variable` > `Add Variable`.
   - Set the variable name to `SUB` with the value of your subscription generator address. For example,
